# python_based_gantt_chart_notebook
The Jupyter notebook and associated sample can be used for creating gantt charts simply by updating the sample csv file.

# Usage

* Download the `Gantt Script.ipynb` file and `Sample.csv` in same directory.
* Run it on the local JupyterLab instance.
* If the outputs are generated, you are all set. If not install any missing dependencies.
* Once it all runs fine, make changes in Sample.csv and run the notebook again.
  * If you create a copy of `Sample.csv` and want to use that, just make sure that in second cell you change the assignment for variable `project_plan` to the new file name.
